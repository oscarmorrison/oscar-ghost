## Customization

### Configuration
I have included with v1.0.4 a way to do some basic feature configuration that is often asked for:
These are the default values (found in oscar.js):
```
let oscar = {
    animatedNav: true,
    tagMenu: true,
    tagKey: '#tagnav',
    requirePosts: false
};
```

**animatedNav:**  if the nav auto hides, or is shown  
**tagMenu:** if the secondary tag menu is shown  
*tagMenu is dependant on ghost api beta feature this can be turned on under [Ghost Admin] -> [Labs] -> [Public API]*  
**tagKey:** what the custom key to look for in the tag description is. (this can be any string)  
**requirePosts:** show only tags that have posts in them  

### Navigation
![NavBar](http://blogoscarmorrison.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/Dec/navigationBar.png)   
The navigation menu can be customize through the [ghost admin](https://blog.ghost.org/navigation/), 
the theme come with 32 custom icons that can be used in the nav bar menu.  
Please see here for all icons http://ogem.co/blogiconmoon  
simply just use the icon class name   
e.g **icon-twitter** for -> **twitter**.

### Gallery
To get the full benefits of the Gallery Viewer (Photoswipe) in a blog post, simply tag the post with 
**gallery**. Any post that is of type gallery will get special behavior. 
* Gallery Post will be displayed differently in a the list post view, they will show special gallery icon, and will not show any description.
* Gallery Post will have special behavior for the user. The images will all have a cursor pointer and be clickable. Once any image is clicked, the photoswipe viewer will open in full view. 
* To add images to a gallery post, add them as you normally would with any post.

### Code Syntax Highlighting
Use [prismjs](http://prismjs.com/download.html) for syntax highlighting.  
in your blog symply surround code block with:

\```language-bash
