### Gallery
To get the full benefits of the Gallery Viewer (Photoswipe) in a blog post, simply tag the post with 
**gallery**. Any post that is of type gallery will get special behavior. 
* Gallery Post will be displayed differently in a the list post view, they will show special gallery icon, and will not show any description.
* Gallery Post will have special behavior for the user. The images will all have a cursor pointer and be clickable. Once any image is clicked, the photoswipe viewer will open in full view.
